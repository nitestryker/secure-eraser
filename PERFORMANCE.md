# Performance Features of SecureEraser

## Overview
SecureEraser is designed to provide high-performance secure deletion capabilities even for large files and drives. This document outlines the performance optimization features implemented in the SecureEraser tool, including GPU acceleration, batch processing, resource optimization, and job control.

## GPU Acceleration

SecureEraser leverages GPU acceleration for faster secure deletion:

* **Random Data Generation**: Uses GPU parallelism for generating cryptographically secure random data
* **Pattern Creation**: Accelerates the creation of complex wiping patterns
* **Verification Acceleration**: Speeds up hash computations for verification
* **Device Detection**: Automatically detects and uses compatible CUDA-capable devices
* **Fallback Mechanism**: Gracefully falls back to CPU if no compatible GPU is available

## Batch Processing

For handling large directories or multiple files efficiently:

* **Parallel Processing**: Uses multi-threading to process multiple files concurrently
* **Adaptive Thread Pool**: Adjusts thread count based on CPU cores and system load
* **Progress Tracking**: Provides detailed progress tracking for batch operations
* **Error Handling**: Continues processing even if some files encounter errors
* **Configurable Batch Size**: Allows fine-tuning batch size for optimal performance

## Resource Optimization

Intelligent resource usage to maintain system responsiveness:

* **CPU Throttling**: Adjusts CPU usage based on system load
* **Memory Management**: Controls memory consumption to prevent swapping
* **IO Prioritization**: Sets appropriate IO priorities to minimize system impact
* **Disk Queue Management**: Optimizes disk queue depth for SSDs vs. HDDs
* **Background Processing**: Allows running intensive operations at lower priority

## Job Control

Flexible job management for long-running operations:

* **Pause/Resume**: Safely pauses and resumes wiping operations
* **Job Persistence**: Maintains job state across program restarts
* **Checkpointing**: Creates periodic checkpoints during long operations
* **Job Reporting**: Provides detailed status and progress reporting
* **Cancellation**: Safely cancels jobs with proper cleanup

## Chunked Operations

Efficiently handles files of any size:

* **Chunk-Based Processing**: Processes files in configurable chunks
* **Memory-Efficient Handling**: Minimizes memory usage even for very large files
* **Adaptive Chunk Sizing**: Adjusts chunk size based on available memory
* **Flush Control**: Intelligent control of filesystem flushing for performance
* **Verification Optimization**: Optimized verification for large files

## Performance Metrics

SecureEraser collects and reports detailed performance metrics:

* **Throughput Measurement**: Tracks and reports MB/s during operations
* **Runtime Statistics**: Collects detailed timing information for each phase
* **Resource Usage**: Monitors CPU, memory, and disk I/O usage
* **Method Comparison**: Provides comparative metrics between different wiping methods
* **System Information**: Reports relevant system information in performance logs

## Storage Optimizations

Specific optimizations for different storage types:

* **SSD-Specific**: Special handling for SSD drives (TRIM awareness, wear leveling)
* **HDD Optimizations**: Sequential access patterns for spinning disks
* **NVMe Support**: Leverages NVMe command queuing for maximum performance
* **Network Storage**: Adjusts behavior for networked or remote filesystems
* **Removable Media**: Special handling for USB and other removable media

## Implementation Details
